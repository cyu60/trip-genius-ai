# TripGeniusAI

This project is an AI powered web app that provides users with AI generated itineraries for travel. 

## How does it work?

TripGeniusAI is fed a location and generates custom trip plans that work around the users time and budget constraints and playlists that match the vibe of the vacation. Additionally, it takes into consideration the environmental impact of travelling and helps users understand and offset their emissions. 

## Benefits

TripGeniusAI provides its users with benefits that help with mental health, cultivate education, and make travel more accessible.   

### Mental Health

Although traveling helps reduce stress, improve mindfulness, and boosts mood, the process of planning for a trip can cause unecessary strain. TripGeniusAI takes the pressure off the travellers and allows them to enjoy the journey. 

### Educational

Traveling can provide a great number of educational opportunities, but finding the right ones can be a hassle. TripGeniusAI makes this easy by providing users with recommendations of travel spots that are educational, allowing travellers to learn through their adventures. 

### Accessibility

A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Traveling can add to this by adding a lot of uneccessary greenhouse emissions, making it difficult to travel green. TripGeniusAI makes it easy for users to offset their carbon emissions, making traveling more eco-friendly accessible.
